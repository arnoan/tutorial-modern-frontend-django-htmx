# Hello Playwright 

We will now install playwright and write our first test.

```
pip install pytest-playwright
playwright install
```

You might be prompted to install some extra dependencies.

## Note

Django uses unit test by default. We are going to be using Pytest instead because pytest-playwright has a lot of functionality.

We'll need to install this as well:

```
pip install pytest_django
pip install pytest-env
```

Also, create a file called `pytest.ini` in the root directory (the same directory as your manage.py file). It should look like this:

```
[pytest]
DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE = yata.settings
python_files = tests.py test_*.py *_tests.py
env =
    DJANGO_ALLOW_ASYNC_UNSAFE = true

```

Make sure you replace `yata` with your own project name

## Write a test 

In your app directory, do the following:

- delete tests.py
- make a new directory called 'tests'
- create a new file inside the tests directory called `test_todos.py` or similar. 
- paste the following code into the file:


```
def test_display_empty_list_on_first_load(live_server, page: Page):
    url = reverse_url(live_server, "index")

    weeee  ## NameError. This is intentional

    page.goto(url)
    page.wait_for_selector("text=Nothing to see")


def reverse_url(
    live_server, viewname, urlconf=None, args=None, kwargs=None, current_app=None
):
    end = reverse(viewname, urlconf, args, kwargs, current_app)
    return f"{live_server.url}{end}"
```

## Run your tests

```
pytest
```

You'll get a failure because of the NameError. This means everything is wired up correctly.

Now remove the NameError and run the tests again.

The test takes a little bit of time to run. Why is that?
