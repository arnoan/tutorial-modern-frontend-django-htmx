# What's next 

Well done! You have reached the end of the tutorial content. We have covered the basics. We know how to build cruddy things with HTMX.

The next thing to do is bring these concepts to life by implementing them on your own personal project.

## And then...? 

Web development is quite a big thing to learn about. We have only just scratched the surface here. 

There are also many common patterns we haven't used yet, for example pagination, toasts/popups/modals, confirmation dialogues, hydration, editing, form errors, filtering...

There are also very important functionality that we haven't looked at at all, for example  authentication, sockets, databases, background-tasks.

And we haven't even spoken about deployment!

At this point you have a solid foundation on which you can build these skills. And it is my sincere hope that you are able to continue your journey and keep growing after this workshop is complete.  

## More workshops 

There are more workshops, covering the above concepts and more, under development. Keep your ear to the ground if you are interested in exploring these topics. 

You are also more than welcome to attend the same workshop more than once! If you feel like you need more time and support, feel free to sign up for the next one.
