# What's next?

We have covered the basics. We know how to build cruddy things with HTMX. 

But there is more to do. We haven't touched on Alpine.JS yet and that is a very powerful tool. 

There are also many common patterns we haven't used yet, for example pagination, toasts/popups/modals, confirmation dialogues, hydration, editing, form errors, web-components, filtering, responsiveness, etc. 

We also took a shortcut when we installed tailwind and there are better ways to do things. 

At this point you have a good grasp of the basics. Let's keep going.
