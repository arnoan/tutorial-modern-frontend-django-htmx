# Test the create form 

How do we want this form to work? We want to fill it in, submit it and then a new item should appear on our page. And the "nothing to see here" message should disappear. 

Let's write some tests and then make them pass.

Execute the following: 

```
playwright codegen http://127.0.0.1:8000/
```

See if you can get it to generate some useful code for you. You wont be able to get it to do all the things you want it to because some things are not yet implemented, but it'll give you a good starting point.

You want to:

1. Fill in the form with a value
2. Submit the form 
3. Assert that "Nothing to see..." is no longer visible 
4. Assert that the thing you created shows up 

Try it out before looking at the code below:

I added the following 2 tests:

```
def test_create_todo_item_gets_rid_of_nothing_to_see(live_server, page: Page):
    url = reverse_url(live_server, "index")

    page.goto(url)
    page.get_by_label("Title:").click()
    page.get_by_label("Title:").fill("foo")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Add").click()
    expect(page.get_by_text("Nothing to see here...")).to_be_hidden()


def test_create_todo_item_shows_new_item(live_server, page: Page):
    url = reverse_url(live_server, "index")

    page.goto(url)
    page.get_by_label("Title:").click()
    page.get_by_label("Title:").fill("foo")
    page.get_by_role("button", name="Add").click()
    page.wait_for_selector("text=foo")
```

It's also necessary to import `expect`

```
from playwright.sync_api import Page, expect
```

## Ok let's run the tests

```
pytest
```

Now you'll see flames. Everything is broken.

The error message says things about "no such table". 

We created a Model, but we never synced it up to the database.

run 
```
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

Then try to run the tests again. Now they are failing nicely :)

Django's migration feature is really useful and hardcore. Learn more about them here: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/topics/migrations/
