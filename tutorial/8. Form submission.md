# Form submission

Django's usual pattern for form submission doesn't quite fit what we need. Usually when a form is submitted, a whole page is loaded. 

We want to do some AJAX stuff and make sure that when the form is submitted then we update the DOM without navigating anywhere. 

This is where HTMX comes in.

Here is what we want to implement:

1. When the user submits the form then we need to use HTMX to send a POST request to the backend 
2. The backend should recognise the url and route the request to an appropriate view 
3. The view should create an instance in the database and return some response HTML. This HTML should represent one item (eg a TODO list item)
4. The frontend will then need to put the HTML into the right place on the page. 

## A new template 

We will need to create a template that we can use to render one item in the list. In my case, the template will represent a single todo list item.

Create a new html file in the same directory as your index.html.  Mine is called `partial_todo_item.html`.

When you build a big HTMX application then you generally end up with a lot of templates. It's really useful to come up with a naming convention that will serve you. I use the word `partial` to say that a template is not a full page, but just a piece of html. 

My template looks like this:

```
<div>
    <input type="checkbox" />
    {{ item.title }}
    <button>
        Delete
    </button>
</div>
```

Since I am building a TODO list, I have a checkbox. I also want to display each item's title (there is a title column on my model and in my form). Lastly I want to be able to delete each item if I want to.

## A new view and url 

Now I need a view. It will receive the POST data from the form, create an item, and render the template.

My view looks like this:

```
@require_http_methods(["POST"])
def action_add_new_todo(request):
    form = forms.CreateTodoForm(request.POST)
    instance = form.save()  
    return render(request, "todos/partial_todo_item.html", {"item": instance})

```

Usually when working with Django forms we do things differently. Usually you'll render a blank form if there is a GET request, and then if it's a POST request we'll do some form validation and then deal with the form data. If you are using HTMX it's useful to do things slightly differently to keep things neat and explicit.

Now we need to add the view to our app's urls.py file:

```
path("action_add_new_todo", views.action_add_new_todo, name="action_add_new_todo"),
```

## Template edits

Now our backend is done. We'll edit index.html

Start off by including HTMX as a script tag in the head of the page:

```
<head> 
...
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/htmx.org@1.9.11"
        integrity="sha384-0gxUXCCR8yv9FM2b+U3FDbsKthCI66oH5IA9fHppQq9DDMHuMauqq1ZHBpJxQ0J0"
        crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
...
</head>
```

Next, we'll need a place to put our items when they show up. We need a dom element to target.

Put something like this in the body of your html:

```
<div id="todo_items" />
```
Pay special attention to the `id` attribute here. You'll need this value later.


Mine ends up looking like this:

```
...

<body>
    <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl sm:px-6 lg:px-8 space-y-4 pt-4">

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 sm:truncate sm:text-3xl sm:tracking-tight">Things to do
        </h1>


        <div id="todo_items" />

        <div class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-transparent/30 pt-6">
            Nothing to see here...
        </div>
...
```

Now we need to make sure that when the form is submitted it does the right thing. We do this by adding a few attributes to the form tag:

```
<form hx-post="{% url 'action_add_new_todo' %}" hx-target="#todo_items" hx-swap="beforeend">
                    {% csrf_token %}
                    {{ form }}
                    <input type="submit" value="Add"
                        class="rounded bg-green-600 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-green-500 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-green-600">
                </form>
```

Read the HTMX docs to see if you can understand what `hx-post`, `hx-target` and `hx-swap` do.

Try submitting your form and see what it does. 

Kinda ugly, but it looks like it's doing something.

Now, run the tests again.
