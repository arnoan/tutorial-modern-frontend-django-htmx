# Tailwind 

If you run `runserver` and take a look at your website, it'll be quite plain and ugly. 

Let's spice things up with Tailwind.

Add the following into the `head` of your index.html file:

```
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>
```

Now refresh your page. You'll notice that things look a little different. Tailwind baselines all the styles so you can build up from a good foundation.

Let's add some style. Update your index.html page so it looks like this:

```
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Things to do</title>
    <script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>

</head>

<body>
    <div class="mx-auto max-w-7xl sm:px-6 lg:px-8 space-y-4 pt-4">

        <h1 class="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 sm:truncate sm:text-3xl sm:tracking-tight">Things to do
        </h1>


        <div class="text-center text-2xl font-bold text-transparent/30 pt-6">
            Nothing to see here...
        </div>

    </div>
</body>

</html>
```

Now refresh your page. It looks much better, right?

## Side quest: Auto refresh 

This is a good time to play with Tailwind for a bit. You can find the docs [here](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/utility-first).

Try tweak things and see what you can change. Change the heading size, the colour, whatever you want.

You'll notice that as you change things you need to manually refresh your browser to see what you have done. This is tedious. 

This package makes life much easier:
