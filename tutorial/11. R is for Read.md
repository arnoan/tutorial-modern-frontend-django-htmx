# R is for Read

Now you should have a whole lot of stuff in your database. But when you refresh the page then we see "Nothing to See here".

We need to update our page so that it fetches things from the database and displays them in the right place. 

Let's start off with some tests.

## Tests 

When there are items in the database, we should see them as soon as the page loads. 

Try to think of the test you would want to write on your own.

Your test will need to:
- create an item in the database. You'll need to use the Django ORM for this
- visit the index page. You can do this in the usual way
- make sure that the item is visible. You can use `page.wait_for_selector` for this
- expect `Nothing to see` to be hidden

Mine looks like this:

```
def test_display_one_item_on_first_load(live_server, page: Page):
    TodoItem.objects.create(title="Test item")
    page.goto(reverse_url(live_server, "index"))
    page.wait_for_selector("text=Test item")  # select dom elements
    expect(page.get_by_text("Nothing to see here...")).to_be_hidden()
```

Here we are interacting with our model in order to make a new item in the database. 

Of course when we run the test, it will fail.

## Now to make the tests pass

Head on over to the `views.py` file.

Add the following import to the top of your file:

```
from . import models
```

Now, inside the index function, we are going to query our database and add some more data to our template context.  Mine looks like this:

```
@require_http_methods(["GET"])
def index(request):
    form = forms.CreateTodoForm()
    todos = models.TodoItem.objects.all()  # NEW
    context = {"todo_items": todos, "form": form} # Added to the context
    return render(request, "todos/index.html", context)
```

Now we need to update the `index.html` template so it renders the items.

Find the element that you were using as the `hx-target` for your form. We're going to put some stuff in there.

We had this:

```
<div id="todo_items" />
```

We can use Django's template language to loop over the items we are passing to the template, and we can make use of our partial template from before:

```
<div id="todo_items">
    {% for item in todo_items %}
    
    {% include "todos/partial_todo_item.html" %}
    
    {% endfor %}
</div>

```

Note that if you are using a code generating tool such as Copilot, it is very likely to mess this part up and give you strange bugs. Always be intentional about the code you write!

When we run the tests again you'll see that we are still failing because the "nothing to see" message is still showing up. The JavaScript function that shows and hides the message is only called when the element is mutated. 

There are multiple ways to fix this. The easiest is to update your utils.js file:

```
window.onload = function () {
    const targetNode = document.getElementById("todo_items");

    const config = {
        childList: true,
    };

    const observer = new MutationObserver(showOrHideEmptyMessage);

    observer.observe(targetNode, config);

    showOrHideEmptyMessage();   // NEW LINE
};

```

## This looks terrible

We are now in a good position to add some Tailwind style to our list. Let's get things looking good. 

Play around and see if you can get things to look good. Here is an example of what you might want to do in your html partial:

```
<div
    class="todo_item border-solid border border-green-100 rounded-lg shadow-md bg-white pl-4 pr-4 pt-2 pb-2 flex justify-between ">
    <div>

        <input type="checkbox" class="h-6 w-6 rounded border-green-300 text-green-600
        accent-green-400 
        cursor-pointer
        inline-block align-middle
        " />

        <span class="inline-block align-middle px-2 font-semibold font-normal
        "> {{ item.title }}</span>
    </div>
    <button
        class="rounded bg-orange-600 px-2 py-1 text-xs font-semibold text-white shadow-sm hover:bg-orange-500 focus-visible:outline focus-visible:outline-2 focus-visible:outline-offset-2 focus-visible:outline-orange-600 inline-block align-middle">
        Delete
    </button>
</div>
```

You can also update index.html so that there is a small space between the items:

```
<div id="todo_items" class="space-y-2">
    {% for item in todo_items %}

    {% include "todos/partial_todo_item.html" %}

    {% endfor %}
</div>
```

## Always be testing! 

Run your tests again, they should still all pass.
