# D is for Delete 

This is similar to the last section. We'll be firing off an event when the user clicks a button. There will be a view, and it will need the id of the thing we are deleting. 

The difference is that we will need to remove the item from the gui once it is deleted.

## Let's write a test

Writing the test for this will require you to go through many of the same motions as we did for the Update test, so we wont go through it in detail. 

As usual, you can use codegen to figure out how to target different elements in the page. Poke around and see if you can figure it out.

My test looks like:

```
def test_delete_item(live_server, page: Page):
    item = models.TodoItem.objects.create(title="Test item", completed=True)
    page.goto(reverse_url(live_server, "index"))

    delete_id = f"delete_item_{item.id}"
    page.get_by_test_id(delete_id).click()

    expect(page.get_by_test_id("todo_items")).not_to_contain_text("Test item")

    with pytest.raises(models.TodoItem.DoesNotExist):
        models.TodoItem.objects.get(id=item.id)
```

Pay close attention to this line:

```
expect(page.get_by_test_id("todo_items")).not_to_contain_text("Test item")
```

We are using the function `get_by_test_id`. So we need to make sure that the div we are targetting has the correct `test_id`. 

Now let's make the test pass.

## View and url

Our view will be very similar to the update view.

```
@require_http_methods(["DELETE"])
def action_delete_todo(request, item_id):
    item = models.TodoItem.objects.get(id=item_id)
    item.delete()
    return HttpResponse("")
```

The url is also quite similar to something we have seen:

```
    path("action_delete_todo/<int:item_id>", views.action_delete_todo, name="action_delete_todo"),

```

## The frontend 

When the delete button is clicked then we want to send a delete request. So we use:

```
hx-delete="{% url 'action_delete_todo' item.id %}"
```

When the response comes back it will be empty. This is great because we want to remove the item we are deleting. 

We'll need to give the main div in our partial template a sensible id such as `id="item-{{ item.id }}"`, then we can target it like so:

```
hx-target="#item-{{ item.id }}"
```

Lastly, we need to make sure we swap out the entire element, not just what is inside the div. So we use:

```
hx-swap="outerHTML"
```
